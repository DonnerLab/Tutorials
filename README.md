# Tutorials
This repository contains tutorials, preferably in the form of iPython notebooks (see the wiki on how to create those using Matlab as well). You will find how-tos and explanations for a bunch of general methods and analyses, and it should be easy to implement those for your specific project.

When contributing, first clone the whole repo, add your notebook, write a sensible commit message and then push the repository back to the server.
